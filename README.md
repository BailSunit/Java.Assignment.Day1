1. Write a program to add 10000000 numbers using Linked List and Array List and compare performances. 

-----Output : Time taken to add 10000000 numbers stored in ArrayList is : 5398 milliseconds
              Time taken to add 10000000 numbers stored in LinkedList is : 5605 milliseconds
              
-----Comparison : In an ArrayList, memory is used contiguously. Data retrieval is faster. Therefore addition is faster. This is                             advantageous when data to be processed is received or stored at the same time. In a LinkedList, memory is divided. Data                   retrieval is comparitively slower. This is advantageous when data to be processed is received or processed                                 discontinuously.
